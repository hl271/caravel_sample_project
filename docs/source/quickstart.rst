===============================================================================================================================================================

---------------------
Starting your project
---------------------


1. To start the project you need to first create an empty Git project on Github and make sure your repo is public and includes a README

2. Open your Terminal. Create an empty folder to use as your Caravel workspace, and navigate to it.

.. code:: bash
	
	# Create a directory and call it anything you want
	mkdir -p caravel_tutorial
	
	# navigate into the directory
	cd caravel_tutorial
	
3. Clone caravel_user_project and setup the git environment as follows

.. code:: bash
	
	# Make sure that ``caravel_example`` matches the empty github repo name in step 1
	git clone -b mpw-5b https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project caravel_example
	cd caravel_example
	git remote rename origin upstream
	
	# You need to put your empty github repo URL from step 1
	git remote add origin <your github repo URL>
	
	# Create a new branch, you can name it anything 
	git checkout -b <my_branch>
	git push -u origin <my_branch>
	
4. Now that your git environment is setup, it's time to setup your local environment.

.. code:: bash
	
	# to install caravel-lite into your caravel_user_project
	# you can install full caravel (not recommended) use ``export CARAVEL_LITE=0``
	make install
	
	# To install the management core for simulation
	make install_mcw
	
	# Install openlane for hardening your project
	# make sure to change <directory_name> with the directory you created in step 2 (In this case it's caravel_tutorial)
	# in this case it is caravel_tutorial
	export OPENLANE_ROOT=~/<directory_name>/openlane # you need to export this whenever you start a new shell
	make openlane
	
	# Build the pdk
	# make sure to change <directory_name> with the directory you created in step 1
	# in this case it is caravel_tutorial

	export PDK_ROOT=~/<directory_name>/pdks # you need to export this whenever you start a new shell
	make pdk
	
5. Now you can start hardening your design

To start hardening you project you need to have a RTL verilog model for your design for OpenLane to harden. You should then have a subdirectory for each module in your project under ``openlane/`` directory, this subdirectory should include your configuration files. Then you can harden using this command

.. code:: bash
	
	make <module_name>

6. Example of a user project can be found by the name of ``user_proj_example``, the RTL can be found at ``verilog/rtl/user_proj_example.v`` and the configuration files can be found at ``openlane/user_proj_example``. And can be hardened using this command

**THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE**

.. code:: bash

	make user_proj_example
	
7. You then need to integrate your modules into the user_project_wrapper. Then you can harden user_project_wrapper using this command

.. code:: bash

	make user_project_wrapper
	
8. To run simulation on your design

You need to include your rtl files in ``verilog/includes/includes.<rtl/gl/gl+sdf>.caravel_user_project``. Then run the simulation using these commands

**NOTE:** You shouldn't include the files inside the verilog code

.. code:: bash

	make simenv
	# you can run RTL/GL simulations by using
	export SIM=RTL
	# OR
	export SIM=GL
	
	# you can then run the simulations using
	make verify-<testbench-name>
	
	# for example
	make verify-io_ports
	
9. To run the precheck locally 

.. code:: bash
	
	make precheck
	make run-precheck
	
10. You are done! now go to www.efabless.com to submit your project!
